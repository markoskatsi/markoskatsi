# About Me:
I’m a final-year Computer Science student at *Kingston University*, on track for *First-Class Honours*. I enjoy exploring how technology can solve real problems, from building web applications to working with data and creating useful tools. I like taking on practical projects that help me learn new technologies and apply them in real-world contexts. I'm currently in the early stages of developing FactCheck, a collaborative platform for community-based fact-checking and misinformation tracking.

## Experience
